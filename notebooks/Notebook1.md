# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

My feedback partner provided super helpful comments that helped me refine my roadmap for my project, and answered my questions that I had about areas I was unsure how my project would be structured. Specifically, they reinforced my desire to add a recurrence feature to my DSL as they noted that this would find this to be a useful feature too. However, they agreed that this aspect of my DSL may be harder to implement than other tasks that I want to complete. So, they suggested that I may want to save this implementation as a stretch goal after I have the core aspects of my DSL up and running. When making this comment, they also took the time to briefly go through an icalendar file they had on their computer and take note of the syntax. I thought that this was an extremely helpful aspect of their feedback as they pointed out to me that there are recurrence flags that can be set within the icalendar documentation. This made me feel less worried about tackling my most desired stretch goal, as my feedback partner helped point me in the right direction to complete this task.
Also, in Mondayâ€™s studio time, my partner and I took the time to explain our projects to each other. At the time, I had a lot of unanswered questions about the direction I would take the project and the details I would need to consider in order to make it happen. My feedback partner did a great job taking in all of the information I gave her about my project and suggesting the direction I should take things. In particular, I mentioned that I was unsure if I wanted my program to generate a calendar in google calendar, an excel spreadsheet, or in HTML. My partner considered this question that I was debating and informed me about Scala wrappers that were created specifically for excel sheets, and provided links for me to check them out. This helped me address one of the most pressing questions that I still had about my project, as I now have decided to go the excel sheet route. I really appreciated this piece of feedback as I did not know about the Scala wrappers which I will benefit greatly from.


## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

My current most pressing issue is where I will get started with my project: getting ical4j up and running in scala. Since I never have done this before, I can foresee it potenitally taking me a decent amount of time to figure out and get working properly. I will keep my progress on this task updated here.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
